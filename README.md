# Current Projects:

## [Anno MDCII](https://github.com/LsHallo/anno-rust) (Progress: ~1%)
Iâ€™m currently working on an Anno 1602 clone in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) using [legion-ecs](https://github.com/amethyst/legion).  
It's hopefully going to feature bigger islands, no ship limit and more.
